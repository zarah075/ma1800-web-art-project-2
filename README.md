a. 

b. My project idea was centred around creating an informative piece of media about current events in my country (Nigeria) while simultaneously commenting on propaganda and low user attention when it comes to news and any information considered "boring." 

  To make this commentary, I used larger text on the homepage to be eye catching and low effort, but smaller text on the pages after so that the user has to be actively paying attention to find where to click to get to the next page. I also included empty pages with one line of text to make reference to peoeple only looking at headlines and drawing assumptions rather that actually reading into what they see.

   My project works mainly with hyperlinks; When open the user is to click on the images on screen to navigate through the pages. What you see depends on where and how much you click, but if the user finishes all pages it leads them back to the index page where the initial images are displayed. This was to ensure that the project comes full circle, symbolising the continues cycle of media propaganda and public ignorance.

   Throughout this project, I encountered many challenges. Firstly, as a beginner to coding, figuring out how to format text and images and move them to my desired area on the page was a difficulty. Secondly, I believe I overloaded the CSS, as last minute it stopped working and I was stuck having to change my original format to adapt to this. It was difficult to figure out how to display text and image in a way that would align with my project without a fully operative CSS. What I would say was my biggest challenge was figuring out how to style multiple pages with one CSS. This is the one issue I did the most research for, and I eventually resorted to giving the bodies on each page different classes under <div> tags to have them called and specified in the CSS. This is whast I believe overloaded my CSS.

   c. The main case studies I used from our seminars were Jodi (Joan Heemskerk & Dirk Paesmans) – "wwwwwwwww.jodi.org" (1995) and Olia Lialina – My Boyfriend Came Back from the War (1996). I took inspiration from the use of many hyperlinks in both works, as well as the abstract navigation they both have. Your experience depends on what you choose as a user, and I attempted to recreate that in my project.

   d. With more time and resources, I would likely have fixed my CSS, hence allowing me to have better formatting in my last few pages. I would also add more pages of information and images, and with the ability to undrstand HTML more than I currently do, I would try my hand at animations and gifs and creating a user experience more similar to what is achieved by Jodi Heemskerk's work.
