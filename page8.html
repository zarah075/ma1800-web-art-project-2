          On the 17th of November 2025, 25 school girls were kidnapped from Comprehensive Girl's Secondary School in Kebbi State. Their vice-principal, Hassan Yakubu Makuku, was shot and killed for non-compliance.

         Shortly after, it was reported that 227 students and teachers were kidnapped by bandits at St Maty's Catholic School in Niger.

        These two incidents, so close to one another, devasted the community and Nigerians everywhere. However that didn't stop people from coming down hard on the government. A similar incident occured in 2017, nearly identical to those in 2025. Being horrified by the parallel urged people to call out the incompetence and "non-chalantly selfish" attitude of the Nigerian government.
